# Project-level domain config

This function allows developers to add a domain quickly.

Version required: <Badge text="2023.1.1+"/>

::: caution Suggestion
It is recommended to use project-level domain config，original config [<ColorIcon icon="tool" /> Setting manager](./settingManager.md) will be used as global config and will have a lower priority than project level config.

The advantage of using project-level config is that when there are many projects, the drop-down box options will be reduced (excluding the config of other projects)

:::

::: tip

1. **Project name**: The project name of the API. If [auto domain](./autoDomain.md) is turned on, for single-module projects, the project name will be automatically set to the project name, and for multi-modules, it will be the module name. Manual replacement is not recommended.
2. **Env**: Different environments, for example, **local、dev、test、prod**.
3. **Domain**: The domain value corresponding to the project name and environment name.

## Auto domain or Generate by config file



1. Refer to this [document](./autoDomain.md) for auth domain, and finally only need to modify the domain name value if not the value you want.
2. Generate by config file: Select `application.properties` or `application.yml` in the project, click on the icon <ColorIcon icon="restfulFastRequest" />.
